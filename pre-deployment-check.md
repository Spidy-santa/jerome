# ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist for Jerome's Birthday Website

## âœ… Code Quality Checks

### 1. Verify Git Repository Status
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve merge conflicts and improve deployment compatibility"
git push origin main
```

### 2. File Integrity Check

- [ ] `cake.png` - Image file exists
- [ ] `jerome.jpg` - Image file exists
- [ ] `jerome1.jpg` - Image file exists
- [ ] `deployment-test.html` - Testing file created

### 3. Code Validation
```bash
# Check for merge conflict markers
grep -r "<<<<<<< HEAD" .
grep -r "=======" .
grep -r ">>>>>>> " .

# Should return no results if conflicts are resolved
```
